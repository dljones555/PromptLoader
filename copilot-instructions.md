# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names and interfaces
- Methods will begin with prefix Bp
- Use camelCase for variables and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks in public methods to handle exceptions
- Don't forge to throw
- Log exceptions using the built-in logging framework
