# Prompt Loader

## Overview

Prompts will be standard operating procedures and knowledge assets for telling your agents how to function.

These will reflect your business rules and processes, and alignment with your organization's values.

Prompt Loader will find the prompts stored in your project, and load into a dictionary for you to use in your code and LLM calls.

It should respect cascading rules for files in a subdirectory, allowing overriding of the one in the parent directory. This is configurable.

Keep your prompts out of your inline code!

Though a WIP, I built this POC with Visual Studio Community Edition 2022, using both Ask and Agent modes.
